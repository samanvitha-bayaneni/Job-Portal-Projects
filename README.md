A Python script that automates the process of collecting job descriptions from LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed job search results, and then uses a website (https://usellm.org/) to generate suggestions for relevant projects based on the job descriptions. The code utilizes the Selenium library to interact with web pages and collect job descriptions.
